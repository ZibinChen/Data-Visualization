Average node degree: 1.523. 
The average number of edges that attached to one node. It represents the connectivity of graph. The higher the average node degree, the higher connectivity.

Diameter of the graph: 8. 
The shortest distance of the most distant nodes in the graph. The shortest distance of any nodes can not go beyond this parameter.

Average path length: 2.485. 
The average length of the shortest distance between each pairs of nodes.
