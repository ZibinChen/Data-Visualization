1. Ease to develop:
Tableau: easiest. No coding skills required. It can be simply implemented following the instruction.
R:relatively easy, as the package ggplot provides a comprehensive toolbox for data visualization. And R studio is more user-friendly. 
D3: relatively difficult

2. Ease to maintain the visualization (for developers)
All of them are very easy to maintain

3. Usability of visualization developed (for end users)
D3 has great features for user interactions. It provides dynamic data visualization, illustrating the data with high dimensions. While R and Tableau is more like static visualizaiton.

4. Scalability of visualization to “large” datasets
D3 and R could handle large dataset well, while Tableau couldn't. 

5. System requirements to run the visualization
Tableau: Relatively high requirement. Need Tableau license.
R:Relatively high requirement when using R studio and multiple package to ensure the code runs properly.
D3: low requirement. Only need html to implement the code.
